# Countdown Game

A Node.js recreation of one of my favourite British TV show *Countdown* (*8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown* TBH), featuring the classic Letters and Numbers rounds.

## Features
- **Letters Round**: Generate a mix of vowels and consonants to form the longest word.
- **Numbers Round**: Solve arithmetic puzzles using randomly generated numbers.
- **Countdown Clock (ToDo)**: Implements a timer for rounds to simulate the real game experience.
